    The <b>SmartComments</b> extension makes it possible to add comments to text fragments on wiki pages. The
    functionality of this extension is similar to the comments functionality of Microsoft Word, and
    thus supports the review process of wiki pages within the wiki. The extension distinguishes between two
    different types of user groups: normal users and administrators. Normal users only have the
    ability to create comments and respond to existing comments. Administrators can comment
    handle and reopen, delete comments, and turn comment mode on or off for everyone.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Opmerkingenmodus_inschakelen">Enable comment mode</span></h3>
<p>On every regular wiki page, if logged in, there is a button in the action bar with the text "Comments". If you don't
    see this button, the extension may not be enabled on the wiki, or an administrator may have chosen to disable
    the commenting mode on the wiki. If your wiki uses a different skin, comment mode can be found in the "Actions" or
    "Views" menu. Click the button to enable comment mode on this page.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nieuwe_opmerking_plaatsen">Adding a new comment</span></h3>
<p>If comment mode is enabled and this page already contains comments, they will now be shown on the page. Commented
    text will display a yellow highlight, and icons corresponding to a comment left on the page will appear in the right
    margin of the wiki page. Comments can only be made on text that does not contain HTML, on images, or on elements in
    an ArchiMate view.
</p>
<p>
    To create a new comment, select a piece of text, or click an image on the wiki page. Then a pop-up will appear
    with a button to post a comment. Clicking this button will open a new pop-up where you can enter the comment text
    and then save the comment. After saving the comment, the page will be reloaded and comment mode will automatically
    be enabled again; the comment you just added will now be visible on the page.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Opmerkingen_openen">Opening comments</span></h3>
<p>To open an existing comment, click on the yellow highlighted text, or on a comment icon in the right margin of the
    page. A yellow icon means the comment has no replies, and a green icon means the comment has one or more replies.
    A pop-up will now open showing the comment text and any replies. This pop-up also provides the option to reply to
    a comment. Please note: It is only possible to reply to a comment if you did not post the comment yourself, or if
    you are not the last person to reply to the comment.

<p>The pop-up of an existing comment shows a number of icons in the bar at the top. Normal users will only see an
    X here, which closes the pop-up. Administrators will see the following icons next to the X:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Mark as resolved": with this button you can mark the comment as resolved, the comment will then no longer be
        shown highlighted in yellow on the page, but will still exist
    </li>
    <li>"Delete comment": this button irrevocably deletes the comment</li>
    <li>"View page overview": this button will redirect you to the Special:SmartComments page, where you will see an
        overview of all comments present on the page on which you clicked the button
    </li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Speciale_pagina">Special page</span></h2>
<p>On this page <a href="/index.php/Speciaal:SmartComments" title="Speciaal:SmartComments">Speciaal:SmartComments</a>
    you will find the following functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>an overview of all comments on the wiki</li>
    <li>administrative functions (only visible to administrators)</li>
    <li>this manual for using SmartComments</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Opmerkingenoverzicht">Comment overview</span></h3>
<p>In this overview you can find all comments that are on the wiki: both resolved and unresolved comments. You can use
    the filters at the top of the table to view comments on specific pages, filter by status, or by author (person who
    created the comment). If the wiki contains many comments, you can use the buttons on the page to scroll through the
    comments. In each row of the table you will see icons in the last column. Normal users only see the first icon of a
    message bubble: you can use this button to open the comment. In this overview, administrators also see the icons to
    mark a comment as (un)resolved and to delete a comment.
